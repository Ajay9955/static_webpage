# static_webpage - automated deployment(Django-Docker-Jenkins)

Here in this project I have created a very basic static webpage using Django and by using docker I containarized the django webpage and by using jenkins I automated(whenever a push operation is performed on repo the jenkins will automatically starts buiding and deploys it) the deployment and finally pushed the docker image to the docker-hub, and I have done all this on an AWS EC2 instance - ubuntu as operating system.
